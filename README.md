------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We here at GseppoSoft (So me myself and I)
are pround to present the first iteration that is to say V1.0.0 of the 
***GseppoSoft PyleManager Software***
to the general public and not just let it rot away on my harddrive for another few days.
I am also proud to say this is the first piece of software mabe gy gseppo soft that is compatible with the **Nokia N900** among other linux compatible mobile devices
this is due to the fact that i designed this software with portability in mind (or rather I made it small and it just so happens to fit on any screen you can imagine)

This software will recieve what I call an "Every So Sometimes" release cycle (It will be updated IF I or the community come up with new ideas to make the software better than it already is.
